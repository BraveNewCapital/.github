# BraveNewCapital 
### Mission and Philosophy
---

At BraveNewCapital, we believe in a decentralized and self-sovereign future where individuals and communities have control over their digital identities, trust, and reputation. Our mission is to build a more equitable and secure digital future by applying principles such as self-sovereignty and cryptographic trustlessness, with a particular focus on identity, trust, and reputation.

We are remixing some old concepts, such as the PGP Web of Trust, using new technology, such as blockchain and verifiable compute systems such as Cairo, to create more powerful and scalable decentralized trust systems. Our focus is on developing decentralized identity solutions that are interoperable across different blockchains and can be used by individuals and organizations alike.

We use new algorithmic techniques to design decentralized trust systems that are secure, transparent, and resilient. Our approach is rooted in cryptography and game theory, and we are constantly exploring new ideas and concepts to enhance the security and privacy of our systems.

We are committed to fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation within the decentralized technology community. We believe that by working together, we can build a more resilient and inclusive digital ecosystem that serves the needs of everyone.

Join us on our mission to decentralize trust and empower individuals and communities with self-sovereignty and cryptographic trustlessness. Together, we can build a better digital future for all.
